# MetaWeatherApp
Android application that shows tomorrow’s weather forecast for specific cities using the MetaWeather REST API.

MetaWeatherApp demonstrates utilizing Android Jetpack components to create a simple weather app.

### Architectural Patterns
Model-View-ViewModel, Manager (Repository), Dependency Injection.

## Libraries and Concepts used:
* [Foundation][0] - Components for core system capabilities, Kotlin extensions and support for
  multidex and automated testing.
  * [AppCompat][1] - Degrade gracefully on older versions of Android.
  * [Android KTX][2] - Write more concise, idiomatic Kotlin code.
* [Architecture][10] - A collection of libraries that help design robust, testable, and
  maintainable apps. 
  * [Data Binding][11] - Declaratively bind observable data to UI elements.
  * [Lifecycles][12] - Create a UI that automatically responds to lifecycle events.
  * [LiveData][13] - Build data objects that notify views when the underlying database changes.
  * [ViewModel][17] - Store UI-related data that isn't destroyed on app rotations. Easily schedule
     asynchronous tasks for optimal execution.
* [UI][30] - Details on why and how to use UI Components in your apps - together or separate
  * [Fragment][34] - A basic unit of composable UI.
  * [Layout][35] - Lay out widgets using different algorithms.
  * ViewPager2
* Third party
  * Dagger2 for Dependency Injection
  * [Glide][90] for image loading
  * [MetaWeather API][4] An automated weather data aggregator that takes the weather predictions from various forecasters and calculates the most likely outcome.
